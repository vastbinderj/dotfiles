.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Obtains access credentials for your user account via a web\-based authorization
flow. When this command completes successfully, it sets the active account in
the current configuration to the account specified. If no configuration exists,
it creates a configuration named default.

If valid credentials for an account are already available from a prior
authorization, the account is set to active without rerunning the flow.

Use \f5gcloud auth list\fR to view credentialed accounts.
