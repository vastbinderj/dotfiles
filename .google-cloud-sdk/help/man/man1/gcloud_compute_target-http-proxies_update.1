.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute target\-http\-proxies update\fR is used to change the URL map
of existing target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by one or
more forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible for
routing. The target HTTP proxy in turn points to a URL map that defines the
rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend
services which handle the actual requests.
