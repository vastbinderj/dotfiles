.SH "NAME"
.HP
gcloud auth application\-default login \- acquire new user credentials to use for Application Default Credentials



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud auth application\-default login\fR [\fB\-\-client\-id\-file\fR=\fICLIENT_ID_FILE\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-launch\-browser\fR] [\fB\-\-scopes\fR=\fISCOPES\fR,[\fISCOPES\fR,...]] [\fIGLOBAL\-FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Obtains user access credentials via a web flow and puts them in the well\-known
location for Application Default Credentials to use them as a proxy for a
service account.

This command is useful for when you are developing code that would normally use
a service account, but you need to run the code in a local development
environment, and it is easier to provide user credentials. The credentials will
apply to all API calls that make use of the Application Default Credentials
client library.

This command has no effect on the user account(s) set up by the \f5gcloud auth
login\fR command. Any credentials previously generated by this command will be
overwritten.
