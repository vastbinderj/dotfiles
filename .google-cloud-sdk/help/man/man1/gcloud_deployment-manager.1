.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The gcloud deployment\-manager command group lets you manage the deployment of
Google Cloud Platform resources using Google Cloud Deployment Manager.

Google Cloud Deployment Manager allows you to specify all the resources needed
for your application in a declarative format using YAML. You can also use Python
or Jinja2 templates to parameterize the configuration and allow reuse of common
deployment paradigms such as a load balanced, auto\-scaled instance group.
