.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute target\-http\-proxies create\fR is used to create target HTTP
proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules which
define which packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The target HTTP proxy
points to a URL map that defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL
map's job is to map URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests.
