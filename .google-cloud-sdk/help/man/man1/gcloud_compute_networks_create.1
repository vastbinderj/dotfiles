.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute networks create\fR is used to create virtual networks. A
network performs the same function that a router does in a home network: it
describes the network range and gateway IP address, handles communication
between instances, and serves as a gateway between instances and callers outside
the network.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
The name of the network.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-mode\fR=\fINETWORK_TYPE\fR
The network type. \fINETWORK_TYPE\fR must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBauto\fR
Subnets are created automatically. This is the recommended selection.
.TP 2m
\fBcustom\fR
Create subnets manually.
.TP 2m
