.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute instance\-groups managed delete\-instances\fR is used to
delete one or more instances from a managed instance group. Once the instances
are deleted, the size of the group is automatically reduced to reflect the
changes.

If you would like to keep the underlying virtual machines but still remove them
from the managed instance group, use the abandon\-instances command instead.
