.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute health\-checks create tcp\fR is used to create a TCP health
check. TCP health checks monitor instances in a load balancer controlled by a
target pool. All arguments to the command are optional except for the name of
the health check. For more information on load balancing, see
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load\-balancing\-and\-autoscaling/



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fINAME\fR
The name of the TCP health check.

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-check\-interval\fR=\fICHECK_INTERVAL\fR; default="5s"
How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example, specifying
\f5\fI10s\fR\fR will run the check every 10 seconds. Valid units for this flag
are ``s'' for seconds and ``m'' for minutes. The default value is
\f5\fI5s\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
An optional string description for the TCP health check.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-healthy\-threshold\fR=\fIHEALTHY_THRESHOLD\fR; default="2"
The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy instance
is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-port\fR=\fIPORT\fR; default="80"
The TCP port number that this health check monitors. The default value is 80.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-port\-name\fR=\fIPORT_NAME\fR
The port name that this health check monitors. By default, this is empty.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-proxy\-header\fR=\fIPROXY_HEADER\fR; default="NONE"
The type of proxy protocol header to be sent to the backend. \fIPROXY_HEADER\fR
must be one of:

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBNONE\fR
No proxy header is added.
.TP 2m
\fBPROXY_V1\fR
Adds the header "PROXY UNKNOWN\er\en".

\fB\-\-request\fR=\fIREQUEST\fR
An optional string of up to 1024 characters to send once the health check TCP
connection has been established. The health checker then looks for a reply of
the string provided in the \f5\-\-response\fR field.

If \f5\-\-response\fR is not configured, the health checker does not wait for a
response and regards the probe as successful if the TCP or SSL handshake was
successful.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-response\fR=\fIRESPONSE\fR
An optional string of up to 1024 characters that the health checker expects to
receive from the instance. If the response is not received exactly, the health
check probe fails. If \f5\-\-response\fR is configured, but not
\f5\-\-request\fR, the health checker will wait for a response anyway. Unless
your system automatically sends out a message in response to a successful
handshake, only configure \f5\-\-response\fR to match an explicit
\f5\-\-request\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fITIMEOUT\fR; default="5s"
If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive a healthy response from the instance by
the time specified by the value of this flag, the health check request is
considered a failure. For example, specifying \f5\fI10s\fR\fR will cause the
check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a failure. Valid
units for this flag are ``s'' for seconds and ``m'' for minutes. The default
value is \f5\fI5s\fR\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-unhealthy\-threshold\fR=\fIUNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD\fR; default="2"
The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy instance is
marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.
