\fB\-\-path\fR=\fIPATH\fR
A path specifying which objects to invalidate. PATH must start with ``/'' and
the only place a ``*'' is allowed is at the end following a ``/''. It will be
matched against URL paths, which do not include scheme, host, or any text after
the first ``?'' or ``#'' (and those characters are not allowed here). For
example, for the URL \f5\fIhttps://example.com/whatever/x.html?a=b\fR\fR, the
path is \f5\fI/whatever/x.html\fR\fR.

If PATH ends with ``*'', the preceding string is a prefix, and all URLs whose
paths begin with it will be invalidated. If PATH doesn't end with ``*'', then
only URLs with exactly that path will be invalidated.

Examples:
.RS 2m
.IP "\(em" 2m
``'', ``*'', anything that doesn't start with ``/'': error
.IP "\(em" 2m
``/'': just the root URL
.IP "\(em" 2m
``/*'': everything
.IP "\(em" 2m
``/x/y'': ``/x/y'' only (and not ``/x/y/'')
.IP "\(em" 2m
``/x/y/'': ``/x/y/'' only (and not ``/x/y'')
.IP "\(em" 2m
``/x/y/*'': ``/x/y/'' and everything under it
