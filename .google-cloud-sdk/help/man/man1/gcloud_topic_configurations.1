gcloud topic configurations \- supplementary help for named configurations



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

gcloud properties can be stored in \fBnamed configurations\fR, which are
collections of key\-value pairs that influence the behavior of gcloud.

Named configurations are intended to be an advanced feature, and you can
probably ignore them entirely if you only work with one project.

Properties that are commonly stored in configurations include default Google
Compute Engine zone, verbosity level, project ID, and active user or service
account. Configurations allow you to define and enable these and other settings
together as a group.

Configurations are especially useful if you:
.RS 2m
.IP "\(bu" 2m
Work with multiple projects. You can create a separate configuration for each
project.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
Use multiple accounts, for example, a user account and a service account, etc.
.IP "\(bu" 2m
Perform generally orthogonal tasks (work on an appengine app in project foo,
administer a Google Compute Engine cluster in zone user\-central\-1a, manage the
network configurations for region asia\-east\-1, etc.)
.RE
.sp

Property information stored in named configurations are readable by all gcloud
commands and may be modified by \f5gcloud config set\fR and \f5gcloud config
unset\fR.


.SH "Creating configurations"

Named configurations maybe be defined by users or built into gcloud.

User defined configurations have lowercase names, such as 'johndoe', 'default',
\'jeff\-staging', or 'foo2'. These are defined by the following regular
expression: \f5^[a\-z][\-a\-z0\-9]*$\fR

Additionally there is a builtin configuration named NONE that has no properties
set.

The easiest way to create a brand new configuration is by running

.RS 2m
$ gcloud init
.RE

This will guide you through setting up your first named configuration, creating
a new named configuration, or reinitializing an existing named configuration.
(Note: reinitializing an existing configuration will remove all its existing
properties!)

You can create a new empty configuration with

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config configurations create my\-config
.RE


.SH "Using configurations"

gcloud may have at most one \fBactive\fR configuration which provides property
values. Inactive configurations have no effect on gcloud executions.

You can activate a configuration with

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config configurations activate my\-config
.RE

You can view and change the properties of your active configuration using the
following commands:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config list
$ gcloud config set
.RE

Additionally, commands under \f5gcloud config configurations\fR allow you to to
list, activate, describe, and delete configurations that may or may not be
active.

You can activate a configuration for a single gcloud invocation using flag,
\f5\-\-configuration my\-config\fR, or environment variable
\f5CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME=my\-config\fR.



.SH "AVAILABLE PROPERTIES"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIcore\fR

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBaccount\fR
The account gcloud should use for authentication. You can run \f5gcloud auth
list\fR to see the accounts you currently have available.


.TP 2m
\fBcustom_ca_certs_file\fR
Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.


.TP 2m
\fBdefault_regional_backend_service\fR
If True, backend services in \f5gcloud compute backend\-services\fR will be
regional by default. The \f5\-\-global\fR flag will be required for global
backend services.


.TP 2m
\fBdisable_color\fR
If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the terminal.


.TP 2m
\fBdisable_prompts\fR
If True, the default answer will be assumed for all user prompts. For any
prompts that require user input, an error will be raised. This is the equivalent
of using the global \f5\-\-quiet\fR flag.


.TP 2m
\fBdisable_usage_reporting\fR
If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected. This is value
is set based on your choices during installation, but can be changed at any
time. For more information, see: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage\-statistics


.TP 2m
\fBlog_http\fR
If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. You may need to adjust
your \f5verbosity\fR setting if you want to see in the terminal, otherwise it is
available in the log files.


.TP 2m
\fBmax_log_days\fR
Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set to 0, turns
off log garbage collection and does not delete log files. If unset, defaults to
30.


.TP 2m
\fBpass_credentials_to_gsutil\fR
If True, pass the configured Cloud SDK authentication to gsutil.


.TP 2m
\fBproject\fR
The project id of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by default. This can
be overridden by using the global \f5\-\-project\fR flag.


.TP 2m
\fBtrace_token\fR
Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of issues. This
token will be provided by Google support.


.TP 2m
\fBuser_output_enabled\fR
If False, messages to the user and command output on both standard output and
standard error will be suppressed.


.TP 2m
\fBverbosity\fR
The default logging verbosity for gcloud commands. This is the equivalent of
using the global \f5\-\-verbosity\fR flag.


.RE
.sp
.TP 2m
\fIapp\fR

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBcloud_build_timeout\fR
The timeout, in seconds, to wait for Docker builds to complete during
deployments. All Docker builds now use the Container Builder API.


.TP 2m
\fBpromote_by_default\fR
If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version will be
promoted to receive all traffic for the service. The flag can be overridden via
the \f5\-\-promote\-by\-default\fR or \f5\-\-no\-promote\-by\-default\fR flags.


.TP 2m
\fBstop_previous_version\fR
If True, when deploying a new version of a service, the previously deployed
version is stopped. If False, older versions must be stopped manually.
