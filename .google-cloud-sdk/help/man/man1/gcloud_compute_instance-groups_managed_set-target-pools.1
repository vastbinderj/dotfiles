\f5gcloud compute instance\-groups managed set\-target\-pools\fR \fINAME\fR \fB\-\-target\-pools\fR=[\fITARGET_POOL\fR,...] [\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR] [\fIGLOBAL\-FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute instance\-groups managed set\-target\-pools\fR sets the target
pools for an existing managed instance group. Instances that are part of the
managed instance group will be added to the target pool automatically.

Setting a new target pool won't apply to existing instances in the group unless
they are recreated using the recreate\-instances command. But any new instances
created in the managed instance group will be added to all of the provided
target pools for load balancing purposes.
