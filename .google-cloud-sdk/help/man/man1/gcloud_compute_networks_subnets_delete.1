\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
The region of the resources to delete. If not specified, you will be prompted to
select a region.

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.RE

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/region

Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
