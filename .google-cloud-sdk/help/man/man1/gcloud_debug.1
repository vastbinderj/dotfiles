inspect the state of an application at any code location without using logging

.SH "EXAMPLES"

To view all available debug targets, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud debug targets list
.RE

.RS 2m
NAME           ID             DESCRIPTION
default\-test   gcp:1234:5678  myproject\-test\-9876543
default\-test2  gcp:9012:3456  myproject\-test2\-1234567
.RE

To create a snapshot in a for a particular target:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud debug snapshots create \-\-target=default\-test foo.py:12
.RE

Note that if there is not a target with the exact name or ID specified, the
target is treated as a regular expression to match against the name or
description:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud debug snapshots create \-\-target=test foo.py:12
.RE

.RS 2m
ERROR: (gcloud.beta.debug.snapshots.create) Multiple possible targets found.
Use the \-\-target option to select one of the following targets:
    default\-test
    default\-test2
.RE

.RS 2m
In the above case, "test" matches both targets' names. Specifying 'test$'
would match only "default\-test" (by name), while "9876" would match
"default\-test" by description.
