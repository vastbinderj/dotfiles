.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Create and manipulate IAM service accounts. A service account is a special
Google account that belongs to your application or a VM, instead of to an
individual end user. Your application uses the service account to call the
Google API of a service, so that the users aren't directly involved.

Note: Service accounts use client quotas for tracking usage.

More information on service accounts can be found at:
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service\-accounts
