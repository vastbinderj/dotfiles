.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Creates a new key within the given keyring.

The optional flags \f5\-\-rotation\-period\fR and \f5\-\-next\-rotation\-time\fR
define a rotation schedule for the key. A schedule can also be defined by the
\f5create\-rotation\-schedule\fR command.

The flag \f5\-\-next\-rotation\-time\fR must be in ISO or RFC3339 format, and
\f5\-\-rotation\-period\fR must be in the form INTEGER[UNIT], where units can be
one of seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) or days (d).
