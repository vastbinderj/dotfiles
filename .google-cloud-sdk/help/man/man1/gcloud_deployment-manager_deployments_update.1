.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fIDEPLOYMENT_NAME\fR
Deployment name.


.RE
.sp

.SH "FLAGS"

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-async\fR
Return immediately and print information about the Operation in progress rather
than waiting for the Operation to complete. (default=False)

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-config\fR=\fICONFIG\fR
Filename of config which specifies resources to deploy. Required unless
launching an already\-previewed update to this deployment.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-create\-policy\fR=\fICREATE_POLICY\fR; default="CREATE_OR_ACQUIRE"
Create policy for resources that have changed in the update. \fICREATE_POLICY\fR
must be one of: \fBACQUIRE\fR, \fBCREATE_OR_ACQUIRE\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-delete\-policy\fR=\fIDELETE_POLICY\fR; default="DELETE"
Delete policy for resources that will change as part of an update or delete.
DELETE deletes the resource while ABANDON just removes the resource reference
from the deployment. \fIDELETE_POLICY\fR must be one of: \fBABANDON\fR,
\fBDELETE\fR.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-description\fR=\fIDESCRIPTION\fR
The new description of the deployment.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-fingerprint\fR=\fIFINGERPRINT\fR
The fingerprint to use in requests to modify a deployment. If not specified, a
get deployment request will be made to fetch the latest fingerprint. A
fingerprint is a randomly generated value that is part of the update, stop, and
cancel\-preview request to perform optimistic locking. It is initially generated
by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify data. The latest
fingerprint is printed when deployment data is modified.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-preview\fR
Preview the requested update without making any changes to theunderlying
resources. (default=False)

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-properties\fR=[\fIPROPERTIES\fR,...]
A comma seperated, key=value, map to be used when deploying a template file
directly.
