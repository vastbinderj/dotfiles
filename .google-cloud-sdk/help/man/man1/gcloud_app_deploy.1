.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This command is used to deploy both code and configuration to the App Engine
server. As an input it takes one or more \f5\fIDEPLOYABLES\fR\fR that should be

configuration's .yaml file.

This command supports App Engine flexible task queue files. The format of task
queue files can be found at:
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref
