gcloud init can be used for initial setup of gcloud and to create new or
reinitialize gcloud configurations. More information can be found by running
\f5gcloud topic configurations\fR.

Properties set by gcloud init are local and persistend, and are not affected by
remote changes to the project. For example, the default Compute Engine zone in
your configuration remains stable, even if you or another user changes the
project\-level default zone in the Cloud Platform Console.

To sync the configuration, re\-run gcloud init
