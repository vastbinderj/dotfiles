.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute instances stop\fR is used stop a Google Compute Engine virtual
machine. Stopping a VM performs a clean shutdown, much like invoking the
shutdown functionality of a workstation or laptop. Stopping a VM with a local
SSD is not supported and will result in an API error.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 2m

\fINAMES\fR [\fINAMES\fR ...]
The names of the instances.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fB\-\-discard\-local\-ssd\fR
If provided, local SSD data is discarded.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
The zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you will be prompted
to select a zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.
