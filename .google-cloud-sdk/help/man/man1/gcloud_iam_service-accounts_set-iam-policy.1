.SH "NAME"
.HP
gcloud iam service\-accounts set\-iam\-policy \- set IAM policy for a service account



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud iam service\-accounts set\-iam\-policy\fR \fIIAM\-ACCOUNT\fR \fIPOLICY\-FILE\fR [\fIGLOBAL\-FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a service account, given an
IAM\-ACCOUNT and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If
the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will
succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag obtained
via $ gcloud iam service\-accounts get\-iam\-policy will prevent the replacement
if the policy for the service account has been subsequently updated.) A policy
file that does not contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for
the service account.

\fIIAM\-ACCOUNT\fR
The service account whose policy to set.
