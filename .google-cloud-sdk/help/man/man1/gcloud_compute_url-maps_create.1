.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute url\-maps create\fR is used to create URL maps which map HTTP
and HTTPS request URLs to backend services and backend buckets. Mappings are
done using a longest\-match strategy.

There are two components to a mapping: a host rule and a path matcher. A host
rule maps one or more hosts to a path matcher. A path matcher maps request paths
to backend services or backend buckets. For example, a host rule can map the
hosts \f5\fI\fB.google.com\fR\fR and \f5\fIgoogle.com\fR\fR to a path matcher
called \f5\fIwww\fR\fR. The \f5\fIwww\fR\fR path matcher in turn can map the
path \f5\fI/search/\fR\fR\fR to the search backend service, the path
\f5\fI/static/\fB\fR\fR to the static backend bucket and everything else to a
default backend service or default backend bucket.

Host rules and patch matchers can be added to the URL map after the map is
created by using \f5gcloud compute url\-maps edit\fR or by using \f5gcloud
compute url\-maps add\-path\-matcher\fR and \f5gcloud compute url\-maps
add\-host\-rule\fR.
