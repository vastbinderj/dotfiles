\fB\-\-all\-users\fR
If set, matching snapshots from all users will be deleted, rather than only
snapshots created by the current user.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-include\-inactive\fR
If set, also delete snapshots which have been completed. By default, only
pending snapshots will be deleted.

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-location\fR=\fILOCATION\-REGEXP\fR
A regular expression to match against snapshot locations. All snapshots matching
this value will be deleted. You may specify \-\-location multiple times.

gcloud debug snapshots delete \e
    \-\-location foo.py:[1\-3] \-\-location bar.py:4

.TP 2m
\fB\-\-target\fR=(\fIID\fR|\fIDESCRIPTION_REGEXP\fR)
The debug target. It may be a target ID or name obtained from 'debug targets
list', or it may be a regular expression uniquely specifying a debuggee based on
its description or name. For App Engine projects, if not specified, the default
target is the most recent deployment of the default module and version.
