.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute target\-pools add\-health\-checks\fR is used to add an HTTP
health check to a target pool. Health checks are used to determine the health
status of instances in the target pool. Only one health check can be attached to
a target pool, so this command will fail if there as already a health check
attached to the target pool. For more information on health checks and load
balancing, see
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load\-balancing\-and\-autoscaling/

\fB\-\-region\fR=\fIREGION\fR
The region of the target pool to add health checks to. If not specified, you
will be prompted to select a region.

A list of regions can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute regions list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
