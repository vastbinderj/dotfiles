.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute target\-ssl\-proxies update\fR is used to change the SSL
certificate, backend service or proxy header of existing target SSL proxies. A
target SSL proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules which define
which packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The target SSL proxy in turn
points to a backend service which will handle the requests. The target SSL proxy
also points to an SSL certificate used for server\-side authentication.
