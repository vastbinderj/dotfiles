.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The gcloud components command group lets you control which tools are installed
in the Cloud SDK. It can be used to install, update and remove components of the
Cloud SDK, ensuring a lean, up\-to\-date installation.

gcloud components regularly checks whether updates are available for the tools
you already have installed, and gives you the opportunity to upgrade to the
latest version.

Certain components have dependencies. gcloud components will install any
dependencies, and during removal, any dependant components will be uninstalled
automatically.
