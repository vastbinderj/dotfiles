gcloud config \- view and edit Cloud SDK properties



.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\f5gcloud config\fR \fIGROUP\fR | \fICOMMAND\fR [\fIGLOBAL\-FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The gcloud config command group lets you set, view and unset properties used by
Cloud SDK.

A configuration is a set of properties that govern the behavior of gcloud and
other Cloud SDK tools. The initial \f5default\fR configuration is set when
\f5gcloud init\fR is run. You can create additional named configurations using
\f5gcloud init\fR or \f5gcloud config configurations create\fR.

To switch between configurations, use \f5gcloud config configurations
activate\fR.

gcloud supports several flags that have the same effect as properties in a
configuration (for example, gcloud supports both the \f5\-\-project\fR flag and
\f5project\fR property). Properties differ from flags in that flags affect
command behavior on a per\-invocation basis. Properties allow you to maintain
the same settings across command executions.

For more information on configurations, see \f5gcloud topic configurations\fR.

\fIcore\fR

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBaccount\fR

Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.


.TP 2m
\fBdefault_regional_backend_service\fR

regional by default. The \f5\-\-global\fR flag will be required for global
backend services.


.TP 2m
\fBdisable_color\fR
If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the terminal.


.TP 2m
\fBdisable_prompts\fR

prompts that require user input, an error will be raised. This is the equivalent
of using the global \f5\-\-quiet\fR flag.


.TP 2m
\fBdisable_usage_reporting\fR
If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected. This is value
is set based on your choices during installation, but can be changed at any
time. For more information, see: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage\-statistics


.TP 2m
\fBlog_http\fR
If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. You may need to adjust
your \f5verbosity\fR setting if you want to see in the terminal, otherwise it is
available in the log files.


.TP 2m
\fBmax_log_days\fR
Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set to 0, turns
off log garbage collection and does not delete log files. If unset, defaults to
30.


.TP 2m
\fBpass_credentials_to_gsutil\fR
If True, pass the configured Cloud SDK authentication to gsutil.


.TP 2m
\fBproject\fR
The project id of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by default. This can
be overridden by using the global \f5\-\-project\fR flag.


.TP 2m
\fBtrace_token\fR
Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of issues. This
token will be provided by Google support.

\fBuser_output_enabled\fR
If False, messages to the user and command output on both standard output and
standard error will be suppressed.


.TP 2m
\fBverbosity\fR
The default logging verbosity for gcloud commands. This is the equivalent of
using the global \f5\-\-verbosity\fR flag.

.RS 2m
.TP 2m
\fBcloud_build_timeout\fR
The timeout, in seconds, to wait for Docker builds to complete during
deployments. All Docker builds now use the Container Builder API.


.TP 2m
\fBpromote_by_default\fR
If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version will be
promoted to receive all traffic for the service. The flag can be overridden via
the \f5\-\-promote\-by\-default\fR or \f5\-\-no\-promote\-by\-default\fR flags.


.TP 2m
\fBstop_previous_version\fR
