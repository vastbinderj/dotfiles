.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute instance\-groups managed abandon\-instances\fR abandons one or
more instances from a managed instance group, thereby reducing the targetSize of
the group. Once instances have been abandoned, the currentSize of the group is
automatically reduced as well to reflect the change.

Abandoning an instance does not delete the underlying virtual machine instances,
but just removes the instances from the instance group. If you would like the
delete the underlying instances, use the delete\-instances command instead.
